## Notes

1. @angular/material
    - Used only for Confirmation Dialog
    - Not used for anything else as the requirement was not to use css frameworks. Obviously @angular/material 
    is not a css framework, but it comes with many tools that when used would brake that rule.
1. Confirmation Dialog
    - MatDialog was used as the requirements had not specified if this should be a page or dialog (no mocks)
